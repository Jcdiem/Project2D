# P2D
A simple 2D game engine built with C++ and SDL2. The game engine currently using meson for build and a custom script for acquiring libraries.

Currently the engine has basic funtionality for drawing objects to the background and adding entities with moving properties.

# Clone Me!
If you need to clone thsi repo, you need to get the submodules too! Otherwise compilation will fail.
You can do that with this command:

```git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git://github.com/Jcdiem/Project2D.git```

# Does this have any use to a non-dev?
Nope! If you are interested in playing a game made on this engine, we will be linking our game repos here as examples. Currently, however, releases have a 'demo' of sorts for testing what stage we are at in the engine.
